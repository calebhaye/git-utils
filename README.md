# Git Utils

Simple bash scripts to make life with git a bit more enjoyable.

## Overview

This repository contains Bash scripts which are intended to make life as a software developer more enjoyable.  

### Worth mentioning

I'm almost certain that there is a better way (git aliases?), but these scripts have been useful enough to me, that I decided to package them up, both for my use, and for anyone else who may find them useful.

## Installing

Add the `git-utils/bin` to your `$PATH`

## Available Commands

**init-git-utils** 
Sources the bash aliases

**git-set-current-feature** 
Sets the $CF variable to the current git branch

**git-show-current-feature** 
Displays the current feature branch (i.e. the current value of $CF)

## Contributing

Any feedback is welcomed.  Fork/commit/pull-request ... yadda yadda :)
